            <p>
              During my immersive six-month training program with O&apos;Clock,
              I acquired a comprehensive skill set that has equipped me to
              navigate the ever-evolving ocean of web development. This
              intensive experience, culminating in the attainment of a
              professional title recognized by the state, provided me with
              hands-on training (include link to Webstellar) and theoretical
              knowledge in a wide array of technologies and methodologies.

            From a young age, I&apos;ve been fascinated by the two seemingly
            contrasting realms of technology and creativity. This fascination
            has recently led me into the dynamic realm of web development, where
            I find joy in blending creativity with technical prowess to solve
            problems and craft captivating digital experiences. I&apos;m
            particularly drawn to the expressive capabilities of React and CSS.
            These technologies empower me to design attractive and intuitively
            navigable user interfaces, providing users with seamless and
            memorable interactions.

            I hold a college degree in languages, specializing in English and
            Japanese applied to business. This educational background has
            equipped me with near-fluency in English and a nuanced understanding
            of intercultural communication, enabling me to effectively
            collaborate with diverse teams and clients. As part of my degree, I
            completed a short internship at a news agency specialized in
            Japanese news. Here, I gained valuable insights into search engine
            optimization (SEO) and had the opportunity to apply the knowledge of
            competitive intelligence and market research acquired during my
            college years. This experience solidified the importance of
            strategic thinking and data-driven decision-making in digital
            marketing. My diverse professional experiences have underscored the
            significance of effective communication, respect for hierarchy, and
            the cultivation of teamwork. I thrive in collaborative environments,
            leveraging collective strengths to achieve shared objectives. I
            sincerely believe in the adage, &quot;If you want to go fast, go
            alone. If you want to go far, go together.&quot; During my recent
            web development training program, I was honored to be selected as
            the class representative. I was commended by the program&apos;s
            tutor for my role in fostering a cohesive and dynamic learning
            environment, showcasing my dedication to supporting and encouraging
            my peers. At the age of 26, I was offered the opportunity to undergo
            managerial training, a testament to my seriousness and rapid
            learning abilities. While I ultimately chose to pursue other paths,
            this experience granted me insights into higher-level
            decision-making processes. It equipped me with a deeper
            understanding of leadership dynamics, delegation strategies, and
            decision-making, enabling me to understand and respect managerial
            decisions in a deeper way.
