              Hello there! I&apos;m Nathalie, a junior web developer with a
              passion for crafting creative digital experiences. I have a
              college diploma (licence) in natural languages but have recently
              decided to start exploring the world of web development. Indeed,
              since childhood, I&apos;ve been captivated by the seemingly
              contrasting realms of technology and creativity. This fascination
              has propelled me into the dynamic world of web development, where
              creativity and technology intertwine to solve problems and create
              new experiences for the users. And I love it!

            <p>
              During my immersive six-month training program with O&apos;Clock,
              I acquired a comprehensive skill set that has equipped me to
              navigate the ever-evolving ocean of web development. This
              intensive experience, culminating in the attainment of a
              professional title recognized by the state, provided me with
              hands-on training (include link to Webstellar) and theoretical
              knowledge in a wide array of technologies and methodologies.
